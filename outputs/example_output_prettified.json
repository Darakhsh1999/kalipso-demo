These systems must ensure trading systems are resilient and have sufficient capacity in accordance with the requirements laid down in Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554, are subject to appropriate trading thresholds and limits, and prevent the sending of erroneous orders or systems functioning in a way that may create or contribute to a disorderly market.",

      "amendments": "To meet the requirement, the policy should include a detailed section outlining the systems and risk controls that will be implemented for algorithmic trading. This should cover: (1) ensuring trading system resilience and sufficient capacity, (2) setting appropriate trading thresholds and limits, and (3) implementing controls to prevent erroneous orders or disorderly market conditions, in accordance with Chapter II of Regulation (EU) 2022/2554. The policy should also specify ongoing monitoring, testing, and review procedures for these controls."
